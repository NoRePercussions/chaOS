# chaOS
kOS low-level OS with task scheduling, modules, and fault tolerance

Documentation at https://kos-chaos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

chaOS is an operating system built over kOS. It features a unix-style terminal, a better in-game file editor, easy configuration of chaOS and kOS settings, and advanced program design through modules, libraries, and advanced task scheduling. The best part - chaOS is fault tolerant, so if your game crashes, you switch away, or reload the vessel, your program will pick up right where it left off!
